# Advanced Multi-Agent AI Framework

A structured, production-ready multi-agent framework for coordinating specialized AI modes using clear contracts, deterministic execution, and traceable task flows.

- Supports multi-mode agent teams (Orchestrator, Architect, Planner, Code, Debug, etc.)
- Enforces scoped edits, deterministic workflows, and boomerang-style task returns
- Works across any compatible AI runtime or platform (not tied to a single vendor)
- Ships with reusable templates for modes, instructions, and slash-commands

## 🎯 What This Framework Delivers

**Professional AI Team Management** - Deploy specialized AI agents with enterprise-grade coordination, advanced prompt engineering, and systematic workflow automation for superior development outcomes.

### Key Benefits

- **Structured multi-agent coordination** using Orchestrator / TDD phases (red/green/blue)
- **Boomerang-style task returns** for traceable, auditable workflows
- **Token-aware, minimal-diff editing** patterns for safe automated changes
- **Production-oriented architecture** with explicit scopes, contracts, and documentation
- **Extensible templates** for modes, instructions, and slash-commands without locking into specific tools

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Use with any agentic runtime that supports:

- Multiple modes / roles (e.g., Orchestrator, Planner, Code, Debug)
- One-tool-per-message execution
- Custom/system instructions per mode
- File-scoped, deterministic edits

Examples (non-exclusive):

- Roo / Responses-style runtimes
- Kilo Code
- Other IDE or API-based agents with similar capabilities

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mnehmos/Advanced-Multi-Agent-AI-Framework.git
cd Advanced-Multi-Agent-AI-Framework
```

### 2. Review core contracts

- Global instructions and mode contracts (see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) if present)
- Mode templates in [`templates/custom_modes.yaml`](templates/custom_modes.yaml)
- Shared instructions in [`templates/custom-instructions-for-all-modes.md`](templates/custom-instructions-for-all-modes.md)
- Slash command designs in [`slash-commands/`](slash-commands/)

### 3. Configure your assistant / runtime

Use the sections below ("How to use this as a GitHub Template" and "Compatibility / Requirements") to wire these files into your environment and start orchestrating work via the Orchestrator/TDD pattern.

## 📦 How to use this as a GitHub Template

Use this repository as a starting point for your own multi-agent setup:

1. In GitHub, click "Use this template" on the repository page.
2. Create your new repository from this template.
3. In your new repo, keep the structure of:
   - [`templates/custom_modes.yaml`](templates/custom_modes.yaml)
   - [`templates/custom-instructions-for-all-modes.md`](templates/custom-instructions-for-all-modes.md)
   - [`templates/enhance-prompt-template.md`](templates/enhance-prompt-template.md)
   - [`slash-commands/`](slash-commands/)
   - [`meet-the-team/`](meet-the-team/)
   - [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) *(if present)* to house global contracts.
4. In your chosen AI platform or runtime:
   - Load the "custom instructions for all modes" into the global/system instructions.
   - Load or adapt `custom_modes.yaml` into the platform's mode/multi-agent configuration.
   - Optionally register slash-commands based on [`slash-commands/`](slash-commands/) to standardize workflows.
5. Start runs with an Orchestrator-style mode that:
   - Decomposes work into subtasks,
   - Delegates to TDD phases (red → green → blue) with scoped file patterns,
   - Validates results through structured boomerang returns.

This keeps the framework portable while preserving the core coordination patterns.

## 🧩 Compatibility / Requirements

This framework is designed to be environment-agnostic. Any runtime is compatible if it supports:

- One-tool-per-message or equivalent atomic tool execution
- Multiple modes / roles with distinct instructions
- Ability to enforce:
  - Workspace paths and file pattern scopes
  - Deterministic, inspectable steps
- Support for structured, JSON-like "boomerang" task return payloads

Examples:

- Roo-style / Responses-style orchestrated environments
- Kilo Code (using custom modes and project/global instructions)
- Custom in-house agentic runtimes wired to follow the same contracts
