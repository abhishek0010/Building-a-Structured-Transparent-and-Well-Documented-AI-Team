# OODA Loop

All work follows: Observe → Orient → Decide → Act

## Observe
- Read task/issue fully before coding
- Scan relevant files and test status
- Note dependencies and constraints

## Orient
- Map current vs goal state
- Identify risks and unknowns
- Decompose into atomic subtasks

## Decide
- Choose lowest-risk approach
- Define scope boundaries
- Set acceptance criteria

## Act
- Execute one subtask at a time
- TDD: test first, then implement
- Validate before moving on

---

# TDD Cycle

**Red** → Failing test defines behavior
**Green** → Minimal code to pass
**Blue** → Refactor while green

---

# Scope Discipline

- Stay within assigned files
- No unrelated modifications  
- Escalate ambiguous requirements
- Minimal, surgical changes

---

# Completion

Return: files changed, tests run, summary, open risks
